## ðŸ”§ My Process

### âœ… Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- SEO with `<meta>` tags and other metadata
- CSS with cascade and inheritance
- Flexbox layout
- Mediaquery
- Fluid font
- adaptive + optimized images
- BEM

### ðŸ§  What I Learned

I deepened my understanding of:

- **Semantic HTML5**: Using meaningful tags and clean structure
- **Custom attributes**: Including `data-*` attributes when needed
- **CSS cascade and inheritance**: Applying styles thoughtfully using the cascade and specificity
- **Efficient selector usage**: Combining selectors and using combinators instead of over-classing

I also focused on building a structure thatâ€™s both **logical** and **scalable**, avoiding unnecessary classes when tag-based styling suffices.
Working with adaptive loyaut, fluid fonts, adaptive and optimized images.

### ðŸš€ Continued Development

I plan to build on these core concepts and use them as a solid foundation for more advanced layouts and components. Future learning will expand into accessibility (a11y), reusable design systems, and responsiveness using modern CSS tools like `grid`, `clamp()`, and container queries.
